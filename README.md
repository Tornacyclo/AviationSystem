# AviationSystem
A simple Python script for simulating an air traffic control system.
This script defines a Plane class with a few attributes and methods, and creates a few instances of the Plane class to simulate planes taking off and landing at an airport. There are more features and functionality, such as handling multiple airports, tracking the locations of planes in the sky, or simulating delays or emergencies.
